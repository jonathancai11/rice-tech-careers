# Rice Tech Careers

A relatively comprehensive list of resources regarding **recruiting/preparing for the tech industry from Rice University**.
Some specific to Rice, some not.
It's also impossible to write down everything, so most of this will be links to resources that go further in detail.

The broad career paths in tech that most Rice students have pursued:

[Software Engineering (SWE)](#software-engineering)

[Product Management (PM)](#product-management)

[Data Science](#data-science)

[Clubs at Rice](#rice-clubs)


And for those not as interested in going straight into industry and considering grad school:

[Grad school](#grad-school)

## Software Engineering

Advice/resources for recruiting for SWE generally fall into two categories:

1. Finding jobs

2. Getting interviews

3. Succeeding at interviews

### Finding jobs

There are plenty of job boards out there, do your Google's for "

### Getting interviews

Resume advice:
- One page (unless you have a long list of publications, which you probably don't)
- Be precise
- Ditch the high school education
- List personal projects with the tools/technologies used for each

Cover letter advice:
- Don't write one.

### Succeeding at interviews

For behavioral interviews:

Behave like a normal human being.

For coding interviews:

You'll have to decide on a language your most familiar with. I would recommend Python, as COMP 140/182 give you a good foundation.

Resources for practicing for coding interviews:
- [Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI)](https://github.com/alxerg/Books-1/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%2C%206th%20Edition%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf)
- [Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI) for Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949) or for [Java](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272)
