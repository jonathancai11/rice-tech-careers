# Rice Tech Careers

This repo is meant to be a one-stop-shop for everything I've learned regarding **recruiting/preparing for the tech industry from Rice University**.
It's impossible to write down every piece of advice, so most of this will be links to resources that go further in detail.

This is mostly just advice and resources that I wish was available when I was a freshman.

Of course there are plenty of other paths and, but these are the few broad career paths in tech that most Rice students have pursued:

[SWE](#software-engineering)

[Product Management](#product-management)

[Data Science](#data-science)

[Clubs at Rice](#rice-clubs)
