# Rice Tech Careers

A relatively comprehensive list of resources regarding **recruiting/preparing for the tech industry from Rice University**.
Some specific to Rice, some not.
It's also impossible to write down everything, so most of this will be links to resources that go further in detail.

The broad career paths in tech that most Rice students have pursued:

[Software Engineering (SWE)](#software-engineering)

[Product Management (PM)](#product-management)

[Data Science](#data-science)

And for those not as interested in going straight into industry and considering grad school:

[Grad school](#grad-school)

But regardless of the career path, there is probably a club on campus for you, see a list of all [Rice "tech" clubs](#rice-clubs).

## Software Engineering

The [r/cscareerquestions subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) has a shit ton of advice/resources. Their [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index) is nice too if you're too lazy to ask or look for specific questions.

Recruiting for SWE generally has three broad steps:

1. [Finding jobs](#1-finding-jobs)

2. [Getting interviews](#2-getting-interviews)

3. [Succeeding at interviews](#3-succeeding-at-interviews)

### 1. Finding jobs

**Start early.** Many job postings come out around early August, even before school begins.

There are plenty of job boards out there, do your Google's for "software engineering internships github 202x".
For example, Pitt CS comes out with a list on their github every year. Here's for [summer 2021](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships).

**Use your network.** When you begin your job search, contact everyone you know in tech, including family/friends. Especially when you're a freshman/sophomore, there's a good chance your first gig will likely come from within your network.

### 2. Getting interviews

**Resume advice:**
- Optimize for information that a recruiter can gain from a <10 second skim
- One page (unless you have a long list of publications, which you probably don't)
- Be precise
- Ditch the high school education
- List personal projects with the tools/technologies used for each

**Cover letter advice:**
- Don't write one.

**Referrals**: Referrals are incredibly helpful. For the uninformed, tech companies often have internal referral systems, where existing employees can recommend you for a job.  So just like in step 1, **use your network**. This will increase your chance of getting an interview a lot.


### 3. Succeeding at interviews

For **behavioral interviews**:

Be nice.

For **coding interviews**:

You'll have to decide on a language your most familiar with. I would recommend Python, as COMP 140/182 give you a good foundation.

Resources for practicing for coding interviews:
