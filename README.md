# Rice Tech Careers

This repo is meant to be a one-stop-shop for everything I've learned regarding **recruiting/preparing for the tech industry from Rice University**.
It's impossible to write down every piece of advice, so most of this will be links to resources that go further in detail.

This is just inspired by my experiences and mileage may vary, of course.
