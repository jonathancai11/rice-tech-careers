# Rice Tech Careers

This repo is meant to be a one-stop-shop for everything I've learned regarding **recruiting/preparing for the tech industry from Rice University**.
It's impossible to write down every piece of advice, so most of this will be links to resources that go further in detail.

This is mostly just advice and resources that I wish was available when I was a freshman.
